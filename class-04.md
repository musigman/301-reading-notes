# Grid Garden Game
So now we are combining grid sections with Flex. While I'm excited to see the possibilities of Flex, I'm a bit skeptical. These games are fun but what I know is that if you don't use these great CSS rules regularly they will get lost. However, If you don't learn them, you'll never know!

That being said I'm enjoying learning about **grid-column** commands using Flex. The **Grid-Column** and **Grid-Row** allow you to style carrots across a grid area. I'm kidding referring to this specific example, but you can cover style over a grid area. 

Using **Grid-Area** you can cover areas of the grid, and not just rectangular areas. I don't fully understand why it allows you to select the areas it does, but it works because I've done it in the Grid Garden game.

The **Order** value lets you target a grid area and style an object in that space.

**Grid-Template-Columns** allow you to specify identical widths across the grid in any percentage increment you want. This is precise! You can use and mix different increments including pixels, ems, and percentages in the same line.

**Fr** is introduced by Grid and it stands for fraction. Using *Fr* you can overlap elements. *1fr* refers to 1/4 space, while *3fr* refers to 3/4 space.

**Grid-Template** is a shorthand property that combines *grid-template-rows* and *grid-template-columns* properties. 

# Growth Mindset
While today I had a *A-ha* moment working with Flex. I'm really excited to learn and work with grid templates. I really enjoy styling pages and these new tools to make layout more friendly. So much has changed with responsive design over the past 5 years that I'm eager to learn about.

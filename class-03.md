# Mustache
JavaScript templating is a technique to render client-side templates by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup and is a fast and efficient. The template engine replaces variable and instances declared in a template file with actual runtime values and converts the template into an HTML file sent to the client. 

**Mustache** is referred to as a logic-less template syntax. the 'logic-less' means there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. There are just tags, and some tags are replaced with a value or series of values. **Mustache.js** is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript mentioned above and supports various languages.

Upon seeing Mustache syntax the one thing that stands out are the use of double curly braces:
{{placeholder}}. This Mustache is curious and abstract. I want to learn more about yarn, and Mustache express. Apparently they work well together. I don't know what it means but that is okay.

# Flexbox
More reading on Flexbox! I was excited by the prospects and promises of Flexbox. I want to believe, really! It really styles divs nicely when it works. I found that the solution to my first lab was not Flexbox. In fact using it really messed things up and once I commented it out, my page displayed like it should. Practice makes perfect!

I really like the layout properties for containers and divs. The flex tool is pretty powerful and versatile alignment tool. Flex gives you the ability to change row directions and columns as well as centering boxes. 

The Flexbox Froggy game was a fun css game to become familiar with the tools of Flexbox. I hope this game is optimized for an iphone. I can see myself playing this learning game standing in line at the grocery store.

## What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language.It's designed to manipulate and transfer data from a relational database. It also provides safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

## Relational Databases
SQL is a relational database that represents a collection of related (two dimensional) tables, similar to an excel spreadsheet. These tables contain lists of stored data. 

## Select
To retrieve data from a SQL database we write **SELECT** statements which are often referred to as queries. A query is a statement that declares what data we are looking for, where to find it, and how to transform it before it is returned.

In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a **Where** clause in the query. This is especially helpful when sorting through long lines of code.

## Distinct
BY USING THE **Distinct** keyword, SQL provides a way to discard rows that have duplicate columns.

## Schema
The database schema is what describes the structure of each table and the datatypes that each table column can contain.

## Insert
When inserting data we need to us the **INSERT** statement which declares where the data is entered.

## Update
This command is similar to the *insert* statement. You have to specify exactly which table, columns, and rows to update.

## Delete
Deleting rows has never been more exiting! No, I'm kidding. When you need to delete data from a table in the database, you use the **Delete** statement.

## Tables
New tables are created using the **Create Table** statement. The **Alter Tables** command allows you to add, remove or modify columns and table constraints. Using the ** Drop Table** statement, You are able to remove and entire table including all data and metadata.

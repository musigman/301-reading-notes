*Anita Borg*, from the Institute for Women in Technology believes the reasons for a lack of women in tech roles can be traced to games created during that time were targeted toward boys.

The trend continued into the 1990s. Researcher *Jane Margolis* found that there was an experience gap between many male first year computer-science students vs. female students.

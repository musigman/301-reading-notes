# The Quest to Build the Perfect Team
Julia Rozovsky tells her stories of working together in group settings. The first setting was a study group that was stressful due to competitive dynamics of the team members. She talks about the feeling of having to ‘prove herself’ in a critical environment.

A second group she talks about is one where ideas were accepted and the environment was social and fun. The contrasting differences set the stage of this article.

Study of Efficiency
The Harvard Business Review reported that ‘the time spent by managers and employees in collaborative activities have ballooned by 50 percent or more’. 3/4 of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues.

Software engineers are encouraged to work together. Studies have found that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and have higher job satisfaction.

My experience at Code Fellows has opened my eyes to working with a group. I’ve found that I enjoy and prefer working with a group and have found it to be a motivating factor in producing great work. It certainly helps to have a second pair of eyes to discover the reason code is not working is because of a simple syntax error.

## Google Studies 
Google spent millions of dollars to research building the perfect team, a research project called ‘Project Aristotle’. The research studied nearly all aspects of employees’ lives. The study followed social patterns and interests, and factors that seemed to have an impact on a team’s success.

## Group Norms 
As Google studied to figure out team success, Rozovsky and her colleagues came across research about ‘Group Norms. Group norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.

## Successful Teams 
The researchers also noticed two behaviors that all good teams generally shared. The first behaviors was sharing the same proportion; meaning that each person spoke about the same amount. This is known as ‘Equality in Distribution’

The second behavior was that good teams had high ‘Average Social Sensitivity’. This means they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on tone of voice and non-verbal cues.

Ultimately the research from Aristotle has encouraged teams to come together by adopting a data-driven approach which includes creating a ’Psychologically Safe’ team work environment.

#REST
I had never heard of Roy Fielding before. Of course someone had to have come up with HTTP in computing. **REST** refers to the web page as a resource. More specifically a browser is an *API* witch stands for Application Programming Interface. This article was clever but is soon became a long 'knock, knock' joke. I decided to look elsewhere about what the acronym REST stood for. 

REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and is a software architectural style. REST defines a set of constraints to be used for creating Web Services.
